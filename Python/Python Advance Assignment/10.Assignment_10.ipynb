    "#### Q1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?\n",
    "**Ans:**  **`__getattribute__`** is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an **AttributeError** of it fails to find an attribute of a class. **`__getattr__`** is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by  **`__getattribute__`**, but for this **`__getattribute__`** and **`__getattr__`** both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, **`__getattr__`** returns a default value. So key difference is that **`__getattr__`** is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class. "

    "#### Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Properties`**: A property is a special kind of attribute that is accessed in the same way as a regular attribute, but its value is computed by a getter method. Properties provide a convenient way to add behavior to an attribute access. For example, you might use a property to enforce certain constraints on the value of an attribute, or to calculate a derived value from other attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Descriptors`**: A descriptor is a class-level object that defines how an attribute is accessed and managed. Descriptors provide a powerful mechanism for controlling access to an attribute, and are used to implement properties and other advanced attribute management techniques. Descriptors are defined by implementing a set of methods, such as __get__, __set__, and __delete__, that define how the attribute should be accessed."

    "#### Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "**Ans:** The Key Differences between `__getattr__`, ` __getattribute__`, Properties and Descriptors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__getattr__`**: Python will call this method whenever you request an attribute that hasn't already been defined\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__getattribute__`** : This method will invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object. Means,if we have `__getattribute__` method in our class, python invokes this method for every attribute regardless whether it exists or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:** With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property function or @property decorator. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, but involes the appropriate function of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptor:** With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of this class to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object."
