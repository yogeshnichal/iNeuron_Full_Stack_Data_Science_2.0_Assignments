    "#### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "**Ans:** Multiple inheritance refers to a feature in object-oriented programming where a single class can inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes. This allows the derived class to inherit the attributes and methods of multiple base classes, providing a way to reuse code and modularize the design of a system. In multiple inheritance, a single class is created by combining the attributes and methods of multiple parent classes, resulting in a single class that has the combined characteristics of its parent classes."

    "#### Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "**Ans:** Delegation is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that involves passing the responsibility of executing a task from one object to another.\n",
    "The idea behind delegation is that an object can delegate a task to another object, rather than performing the task itself. This way, objects can be designed to be flexible, reusable, and maintainable."

    "#### Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "**Ans:** Composition is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that involves creating objects that are made up of other objects. It allows you to create complex objects from simpler objects. The relationship between the composed objects is defined such that changes in the state of one object affect the state of other objects. In composition, an object does not inherit from another object, but instead contains a reference to another object and delegates certain tasks to it. This relationship is usually referred to as \"has-a\" relationship."

    "#### Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "**Ans:** Pseudoprivate attributes are class attributes that are intended to be private but cannot be made truly private in Python. These attributes are named using a double underscore prefix, which causes their names to be mangled by adding a prefix with the class name. The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to signal to other programmers that the attribute should be treated as if it were private and should not be accessed directly outside the class. This helps to enforce the class's abstractions and protect its internal state."
