    "#### Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "**Ans:** In regular expressions, greedy syntax refers to a pattern that tries to match as much of the input string as possible. The opposite of greedy syntax is non-greedy syntax, which tries to match as little of the input string as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy pattern, you can add a `?` character after a repetition operator (e.g., `*, +, ?, {m,n}`). This changes the behavior of the repetition operator from greedy to non-greedy, so that it tries to match as little of the input string as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the pattern .*:\n",
    "\n",
    "With greedy syntax, this pattern would match the entire input string. For example, when matching against the string abc, the pattern `.*` would match abc.\n",
    "\n",
    "With non-greedy syntax, this pattern would match as little of the input string as possible. To make the pattern non-greedy, we add a `?` character after the repetition operator: `.*?.` When matching against the string `abc`, the pattern `.*?` would match only the first character `a`."

    "**Ans:** The Greedy Match will try to match as many repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. The Non Greedy Match will try to match as few repetitions of the quantified pattern as possible. If only Non Greedy Match is available, we can use other filtering or pattern matching methods of regex and further identify the required pattern."

In contrast, **`re.search()`** will only return the first occurrence that matches the specified pattern. **`re.findall()`** will iterate over all the lines of the file and will return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in a single step."
